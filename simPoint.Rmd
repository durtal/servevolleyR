title: "simPoint"
---
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(servevolleyR)
```

Simulate a service point given a number of parameters for the server, that include probability of the server winning a point on their first serve, on their second serve, and the probability that their first serve will go in.

### Usage

```{r eval=FALSE}
simPoint(p, p2 = NULL, firstServe = NULL)
```

### Arguments

param | details
------|--------
p | probability of server winning point on their first serve
p2 | probability of server winning point on their second serve
firstServe | probability of first serve being in

### Return

The value returned is numeric, 1 if the server wins and 0 if the returner wins.

### Example

```{r}
simPoint(p = .78, p2 = .56, firstServe = .67)
```

Use `replicate` to simulate many points:

```{r}
pts <- replicate(1e3, simPoint(p = .78, p2 = .56, firstServe = .67))
# summarise results
table(pts) / sum(table(pts))
```
